% linear_dyn.m
% returns an offset that can be added to data that increases linearly with
% time, based on cputime, first time it is called is start time
%
% equation is: offset = (cputime - tnot)*scalefactor
%  where tnot = cputime at the first call
%        scalefactor = value that slows or speeds up linear movement
%
% usage: [offset] = linear_dyn(scalefactor)
